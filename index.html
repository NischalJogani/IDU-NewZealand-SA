									<h3>The Instant Lane</h3>
									<p>People chose the private sector because they desire to avoid huge lines and non-emergency responses, despite the fact that private sector charges are significantly higher than public sector costs. These unplanned expenditures drive few households below or dangerously near to the poverty line.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>The Free Recovery</h3>
									<p>Under the country's public health-care system, permanent residents of New Zealand have access to free or significantly subsidized hospital care and emergency treatment. The most noticeable disadvantage is the patient waiting time for non-emergency surgeries, therefore choosing the most time-efficient option is preferable.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-hospital"></span>
									<h3>Easily Approchable</h3>
									<p>In 2019, the government spent 20.6 billion USD on the whole healthcare industry, the vast bulk of which went to public healthcare. If we can ration it such that treatment rates for citizens fall and the government pays for it, then private healthcare will be available to the majority of the people and hospitals will not take a loss.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>Fairly Distributed</h3>
									<p>In order to improve public healthcare, people will be able to receive care closer to home. Doctors and other health care providers will collaborate with community services to educate and maintain people's health. Digital technology will be utilised to give services to individuals at their homes in new and enhanced ways.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-hospital"></span>
									<h3>All on Ethics</h3>
									<p>If we reduce the cost of private healthcare, more individuals will seek it out for non-emergency requirements. This would place a lot of strain on the hospital's physicians and nurses, raising the demand for better and more spontaneous health care. As a result, residents must be cautious and use the available healthcare services wisely.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>Where Money Matters</h3>
									<p>When healthcare costs are lowered, citizens can save a significant amount of money, which they can then spend on a wide range of wants and needs. Because the government would pay the reduced price, private hospitals would not suffer a loss. Furthermore, the yearly healthcare expenditure must be rationed by the government.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>Government's POV</h3>
									<p>As a Ministry of Health, the government has decided to provide people with subsidies in order for them to get and receive health insurance at a lower cost, ensuring that everyone has access to medical treatment and does not have to pay for hospital bills out of their own wallets. Subsidies can take the shape of programmes, authorization cards, schemes, or other commonly recognised forms.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-hospital"></span>
									<h3>Citizen's POV</h3>
									<p>Now that hospital expenses have been reduced and the government is providing subsidies, we citizens may save a significant amount of money and invest it in better education, lifestyle, or other necessities. This reduces our burden of receiving high-quality healthcare at a minimal cost and relieves us of worry.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>Hospitals' POV</h3>
									<p>As for us, we are not as affected as the other stakeholders since we receive the same treatment rates and earnings. The only difference is that we charge less from people for the services, and the government pays the remainder.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clinic-medical"></span>
									<h3>Pharmaceutical  Companies'  POV</h3>
									<p>We, on the same hand, are not as affected as the other stakeholders because we receive the same prices and revenues for the prescriptions and drugs. The only difference is that we charge little from consumers for the drugs, and the government pays the rest.</p>
